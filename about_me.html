                <h3>Summer Trip</h3>
			    <p style="padding-left: 1%">This past summer my family and I went on a short weekend trip to Hong Kong. <br/>
                    I had the opportunity to connect with some old friends that I hadn't seen in years, <br/>
                    and explore some local landmarks.</p>

                <h3>Favorite Restaurant</h3>
                <p style="padding-left: 1%"><a href="https://www.dakzen.net/">Dakzen in Davis Square</a> has some of the best Thai Food I've had in the States. <br/>
                    I highly recommend their Khao Moo Dang or Khao Soi. All of their dishes are very authentic and delicious.

                    My favorite dish would have to be a classic <br/>
                    Thai pork congee. This dish is usually served <br/>
                    with a poached egg, crispy fried dough, ginger, <br/>
                    and green onion</p>
